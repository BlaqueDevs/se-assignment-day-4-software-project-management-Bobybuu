1. **Accurate Cost Estimation**  
   - Use estimation techniques like **Analogous Estimation**, **Parametric Estimation**, or **Bottom-up Estimation**.  
   - Consider historical data from similar projects to forecast expenses accurately.  

2. **Define Clear Project Scope**  
   - Avoid scope creep by setting clear requirements and objectives.  
   - Use a **Change Control Process** to evaluate the impact of any modifications before approval.  

3. **Break Down the Project into Phases**  
   - Use an **incremental approach** (e.g., Agile or phased development) to control spending at each stage.  
   - Regularly review progress and adjust budgets accordingly.  

4. **Monitor & Track Expenses in Real-Time**  
   - Utilize **budget tracking tools** like Jira, Trello, Microsoft Project, or Asana to keep financial records transparent.  
   - Set up cost baselines and compare actual spending against planned budgets.  

5. **Allocate Resources Efficiently**  
   - Ensure the right number of developers, testers, and designers are assigned to tasks.  
   - Avoid overstaffing or underutilization of team members.  

6. **Negotiate with Vendors & Optimize Licensing Costs**  
   - Choose cost-effective software tools and infrastructure.  
   - Consider **open-source solutions** or **cloud-based services** with flexible pricing.  

7. **Implement Risk Management Strategies**  
   - Identify financial risks early (e.g., vendor delays, technical failures, or unexpected changes).  
   - Set aside a **contingency fund** (typically 10-20% of the total budget) to cover unforeseen costs.  

8. **Automate Repetitive Tasks**  
   - Use **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipelines to reduce manual efforts.  
   - Implement automated testing to cut down debugging costs.
